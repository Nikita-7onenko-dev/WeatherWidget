# Weather Widget

Responsive weather widget on native js.

Originally created for JavaScript practice, with a design improvised without a predefined layout.
Since then, I have adopted modern development approaches, but I keep this project as a reference point to showcase my progress.

## Functionality
- Automatic IP city detection (without requesting geolocation permission)
- Display current weather by geolocation
- Switch between cities
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
